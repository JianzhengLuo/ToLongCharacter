# To Long Character

## Usage

Put in what you want to convert, get the long (by splitting) character(s).

## Contribute

Since there are so much Chinese characters, it's difficult to split them all by my self, so we need your help. How? Send the splitting to me by social medias (for my classmates) or on GitHub -  

Folk the project => Change the `characters.json` => Commit the changes => Create a PR => That's all! (Of course waiting for me to review. )

While sending me your help, do not forget to **SEND THE INFORMATION YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHOW** (your name, description, links to your social media, etc).
